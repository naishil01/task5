internship(Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA))
After creating the visualizations, summarize your key observations. For instance:
1. There are distinct separations between the species in the pairplot, especially for petal length and petal width.
2. The correlation heatmap reveals a strong correlation between petal length and petal width.
3. The histograms show that sepal length and petal length have somewhat normal distributions, while sepal width is skewed.
4. Boxplots indicate that Iris-setosa has a lower range for petal length compared to the other species.
